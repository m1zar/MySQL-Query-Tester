# MySQL-Query-Tester


Ultra simple page, for developers, to simply run queries and get a table of results back. 

Just put this on your development server to have a simple way to check/test queries against your SQL/MySQL database.

Put the query.php into the html folder, and access via <servername/ip address>/query.php

NOTE: This is not suitable for a LIVE site, unless you are looking to give everyone access to your database!  

Only dependancy is a web server with php and MySQL/SQL/MariaDB..

Mainly based on code snippets from blogs and learning sites.
